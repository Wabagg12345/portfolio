    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <main>
    <p>My name is William Baggett, I was born in Macon, GA on December 30, 2006. While, I was born in Macon, I grew up in East Dublin, GA and I'm still living there as of writing this</p>
    <p>As of writing this, I am currently enrolled at Middle Georgia State University studying Information Technology.</p>
    <p>I've always loved technology since I was six years old back in 2012 when I got my first game console, the Wii. I loved playing games on it and exploring the different channels. However, ten years later, in the summer of 2022, I had a crazy idea. I wanted to bring back the Wii Shop Channel because it shutdown back in 2019 and I knew there was a whole html archive of the channel before it shutdown. So, I did tons of research until I met someone on Discord, he went by Dakotath, he was also working on a Wii Shop Channel Revival, so we decided to work together. At first, I had no clue what I was doing. I was like what in the heck does all this mean? He then taught me HTML and a little bit of python. Specifically, running a flask server that serves html files that the Wii connects to in order to load our custom Wii Shop Server. Since then, I've been getting better at it and we worked on other Wii-related projects together as well. One time, we made our own custom Nintendo Channel server, which could play any videos we had on the server. It was fun for me and that made me realize that I would want to do something related to computers and coding as a career.</p>
