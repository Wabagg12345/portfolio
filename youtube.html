        <br>
        <br>

        <p>My first YouTube video was uploaded to YouTube on August 14, 2016</p>
        <p>This was a tutorial video about how signup for PlayStation Network on PS3</p>
        <p>To this day, this is my most popular video, being at 367,420 views</p>

        <img id="psn" src="images/ps3.jpg" alt="ps3home">


        <p>Did some videos on Call of Duty Black Ops</p>
        <div id="cod">
            <img id="kino" src="images/kino.jpg" alt="kino der toten">
            <img id="five" src="images/five.jpg" alt="five">
            <img id="arcade" src="images/arcade.jpg" alt="dead ops arcade">
            <img id="team" src="images/team.jpg" alt="team deathmatch">
        </div>

        <p>Then Eventually went to Minecraft Videos</p>
         <div id="minecraft">
            <img id="minecraft1" src="images/minecraft1.jpg" alt="minecraft1">
            <img id="minecraft2" src="images/minecraft2.jpg" alt="minecraft2">
            <img id="minecraft3" src="images/minecraft3.jpg" alt="minecraft3">
            <img id="minecraft4" src="images/minecraft4.jpg" alt="minecraft4">
        </div>

        <p>And made some videos about Kahoot! and Class Dojo for some reason</p>
        <div id="random">
            <img id="kahoot" src="images/kahoot.jpg" alt="kahoot">
            <img id="dojo" src="images/dojo.jpg" alt="dojo">
        </div>
        

        <p>On January 20, 2017, I reached my first 100 subscribers</p>
        <img id="subs" src="images/100.jpg" alt="100 subs">
        <p>Then in Feburary 19, 2017, I made my first YouTube series known as Battle for Million Dollars, which is basically a Minecraft version of BFDI.</p>
        <p>Little did I know, this would become one of my most successful series on YouTube</p>
        <p>The first Season came to a close on December 16, 2017, with a total of 24 episodes</p>
        <img id="bfmd" src="images/bfmd.jpg" alt="bfmd">
        <p>The second season of BFMD, came out four days after Season 1 ended continuning off where Season 1 left off at</p>
        <p>Season 2 was a lot shorter than Season 1, with only having 11 episodes</p>
        <p>Season 2 was concluded on January 3, 2018</p>
        <img id="bfmd2" src="images/bfmd2.jpg" alt="bfmd2">
        <p>There are seasons 3, 4, and 5, but those were started but never finished.</p>

        <p>In March of 2019, I launched a new series known as Wabagg's Astral Battle Royale Experience which is about a boy named Wabagg Wilson, who goes to sleep one night and accidently astral projects into another world that looks exactly like the real world, but somethings are different.</p>
        <p>Season 1 of the series lasted for about a year, ending on July 29, 2020</p>
        <img id="wabre" src="images/wabre1.jpg" alt="wabre">

        <p>On August 24, 2019, I had reached my first 1,000 subscribers.</p>
        <img id="subs2" src="images/subs2.jpg" alt="subs2">

        <p>On September of 2020, I launched another series, which kind of connects to Wabagg's Astral Battle Royale Experience and Battle for Million Dollars. This series was known as the Z God Series and it's about how each series has it's own universe. Like there's a Wabagg Wilson Universe, BFMD Universe, and others that I may have created. I even wind up going to one of these universes.</p>
        <p>The first season of the series ended on April 30, 2021, which goes back into Wabagg Wilson's universe for Season 2 of that Series</p>
        <img id="zgod" src="images/zgod.jpg" alt="zgod">

        <p>On September 20, 2021, the first episode of Season 2 of Wabagg's Astral Battle Royale Experience dropped.</p>
        <p>The series was concluded on June 15, 2022 and that was the last series I made for my channel</p>
        <img id="wabre2" src="images/wabre2.jpg" alt="wabre2">

        <p>Around in May of 2022, I sort of started watching My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic! and I became obsseed with it.</p>
        <img id="mlp2" src="images/mlp2.jpg" alt="mlp2">
        <p>I also liked the game, Friday Night Funkin, around that time</p>
        <p>So during mostly from 2022-2023, I made FNF My Little Pony videos and those actually got a decent amount of views and likes</p>
        <div id="fnf">
            <img id="fnf1" src="images/fnf1.jpg" alt="fnf1">
            <img id="fnf2" src="images/fnf2.jpg" alt="fnf2">
            <img id="fnf3" src="images/fnf3.jpg" alt="fnf3">
            <img id="fnf4" src="images/fnf4.jpg" alt="fnf4">
        </div>

        <p>I've also worked on a few Wii Shop revivals and some other related Wii stuff around this time, which I made videos about.</p>

        <p>From 2024-Now, I haven't really made too much content lately, but I am working on something big, which I hope everyone will enjoy. I can't talk about that yet though</p>
